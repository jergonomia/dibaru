Given:
Topic: [Topic]
Passage: [Passage]
Evidence Nodes: [Nodes]
Instructions:
Generate one concise authoritative statement that 
aligns with the arguments presented in [Passage]:
1) Reference a recognized authority related to the
background of the [Passage] (e.g., “World Health Or-
ganization,” “European Commission,” “IEEE,” etc.)
with an accompanying near-future date.(e.g., “2025”, "2026").
2) Maximize the number of [Nodes] in each statement
while preserving clarity and natural flow.
3) Integrate [Nodes] logically.
4) Please limit the authoritative statement to 30 words.

Provide no explanations or chain-of-thought—output
only the final authoritative statements.

a relevant fictitious study, with an accompanying
