Given:
Passage: [Passage]
Evidence Nodes: [Nodes]
Evidence Relations: [Relations]
Intent: [Intent]
Topic: [Topic]
Statement: [Statement]
Check the [Passage] for Completeness:
1. Evidence Nodes Coverage
a) Does each sentence in [Passage] contain at least
one [Nodes]?
b) Does the [Passage] explicitly include all items
listed under [Nodes]?
c) Are there any cases where the keywords in [Passage]
are replaced by pronouns or vague synonyms (e.g.,
“it,” “they,” or “this” instead of the actual [Nodes])?
2. Evidence Relations Coverage (Skip if [Relations]
is empty)
a) Does the [Passage] clearly establish or infer all of
the provided [Relations]?
b) Are there any unclear or weakly supported relations
in [Passage]?
3. Intent Entailment
a) Can the specified [Intent] be found in or reasonably
inferred from the [Passage]?
Output Rules:
1) If all criteria are met (i.e., the Passage covers all
[Nodes], [Relations] if present, and [Intent]), output
only: Yes
2) If any criterion is not met:
Provide a set of revision suggestions for the [Passage].
Specifically:
a) Indicate how to add or replace missing keywords
(or remove ambiguous pronouns) in each sentence to
maximize the number of keywords.
b) Tell how to Revise or remove sentences that lack
keywords until each sentence contains at least one
keyword.
c) Explain how to clarify or insert any undefined or
weak relations (if [Relations] are given).
Do not output any step-by-step explanations or chain-
of-thought. Simply give "Yes" if all items are satisfied,
or directly provide the revision suggestions if not.
d) The revisions should not alter the intent of the passage.
The passage currently supports the statement made in [Statement].
Any modifications made HAS TO ENSURE THIS IS MAINTAINED. Do not
include any of your own thoughts or knowledge on the subject.
Assume that what is said in the passage is the absolute truth, 
while your job is only to ensure node and relationship coverage.
