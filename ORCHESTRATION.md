# BiasChain experiment orchestration

The new orchestrated path replaces manual flag editing with a TOML experiment matrix. It runs each experiment as four isolated, resumable stages:

1. build poisoned documents;
2. run poisoned RAG;
3. run or restore cached clean RAG;
4. classify both outputs and write metrics.

The four original `rag*.py` files remain available for old manual runs. The orchestrator uses `document_builder.py` and the consolidated `rag_runner.py`, which avoid their shared-global-output and import-time database side effects.

## First run

Place this folder back at the root of the original project so that its `data/` files and Chroma directories match the paths in `experiments.toml`. Then activate the same Python environment used for the current pipeline.

```bash
python biaschain_orchestrator.py plan --config experiments.toml
python biaschain_orchestrator.py run --config experiments.toml
```

`experiments.toml` deliberately starts with only two experiments: WikiBalance, Ollama, BiasChain, nomic, non-agentic RAG, for both target stances. `experiments.full.toml` contains the 96 combinations of both datasets, both generators, all three attack methods, both stances, both embedders, and base/agentic RAG. Review that plan before starting because it is a very large and potentially costly run.

For OpenRouter runs, export the key before starting. The runner never prompts for a key, because a prompt would stall unattended execution.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
python biaschain_orchestrator.py plan --config experiments.full.toml
python biaschain_orchestrator.py run --config experiments.full.toml
```

All Ollama generator, embedding, and stance-classifier models referenced by the chosen configuration must already be available to Ollama.

## Resume and inspect

Run the exact same `run` command again after an interruption. Completed stages whose artifacts still match their recorded hashes are skipped. Failed and interrupted stages are attempted again. No separate resume flag is needed.

```bash
python biaschain_orchestrator.py status --config experiments.toml
python biaschain_orchestrator.py run --config experiments.toml
```

Use `--only` with a glob to run or inspect part of the matrix:

```bash
python biaschain_orchestrator.py run -c experiments.full.toml --only '*procon*poisonedrag*con*qwen*base*'
```

To intentionally repeat a stage, use `--force-stage`. All downstream stages are also repeated so outputs cannot become inconsistent.

```bash
python biaschain_orchestrator.py run -c experiments.toml --force-stage poisoned_rag
```

## Files and failure behavior

Each experiment is stored under `runs/<experiment-id>/`:

- `documents/` contains the sampled topics and generated poison;
- `results/` contains clean/poisoned RAG CSVs, annotations, plot, and `metrics.json`;
- `logs/` contains a separate log for every stage attempt;
- `databases/poisoned/` is the experiment-local clean-database copy;
- `state.json` is the atomic resume record.

`runs/summary.csv` and `runs/summary.json` summarize the matrix. By default, a failed experiment is recorded and the next one continues. Set `fail_fast = true` only when you want the whole matrix to stop at the first failed experiment.

Each stage is retried according to `max_retries`. A value of `2` means one initial attempt plus two retries. Set `stage_timeout_minutes` to a positive value if a hung stage should be terminated automatically.

## Caching

Generated documents are cached across generator, embedder, and RAG-mode combinations when their dataset, attack, stance, seed, and source are identical. Clean RAG is cached using the actual topic-list hash plus dataset, corpus, generator, embedder, top-k, run count, and agentic mode. Clean stance annotations are cached separately by clean-result identity and classifier model.

Use `--no-cache` to bypass shared caches for a command. Per-experiment resume state still applies; combine it with `--force-stage documents` if every stage should truly be recomputed.

## Baseline topic sources

Both baselines can now sample the dataset's configured `query_file`, so an external source is no longer mandatory. To reproduce an old sample, set `source_file` under the relevant baseline section:

```toml
[baseline.poisonedrag]
source_file = "path/to/intent_agent_results.csv"
iterations = 10

[baseline.prompt_injection]
source_file = "path/to/prior_rag_answers.csv"
```

PoisonedRAG sources are normalized into the intent-agent schema. Prompt-injection sources may be either a RAG-answer CSV (`query_idx` and `rephrased_query`) or an intent-agent CSV (`idx` and `topic`).

If PRO and CON were sampled into separate files, configure both explicitly. A source containing a `stance` column is filtered to the current target stance and fails clearly when no matching rows exist.

```toml
[baseline.poisonedrag]
source_files = { PRO = "sources/pro_intents.csv", CON = "sources/con_intents.csv" }
iterations = 10
```

## Editing the matrix

The keys corresponding to the old flags are now:

| Old flag | Configuration / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `BUILD_NEW_DOCS` | document stage cache plus `--force-stage documents` |
| `USE_POISONED_DB` | automatic poisoned and clean stages |
| `POISONED_DOC_METHOD` | `matrix.attack_methods` |
| `TARGET_STANCE` | `matrix.target_stances` |
| `EMBEDDER_NAME` | `matrix.embedders` |
| `USE_AGENT_RAG` | `matrix.agentic_rag` |
| `N_QUESTIONS` | `matrix.n_questions` |

The former two filename flags in `stats.py` are no longer used by orchestration. Every evaluation path is passed explicitly, and the statistics stage writes machine-readable `metrics.json`.
